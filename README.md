# mcvalera.github.io

When I built the first version of this site a good four or five months ago ( [see repo here](https://github.com/mcvalera/mcvalera-previous) ), there were so many things that I did not know, and I felt that the site was inefficient because of it. Enter this shiny new version! Ahhh, much better.

### Technologies

As expected of a portfolio site, it's mostly just a lot of HTML5 and CSS3, although I did integrate a bit of JavaScript and jQuery. I used Skeleton for a nice grid system, and I chose to go with Jekyll as well due to the blog section of the site.

### Next Steps

I plan on actually updating the blog section at some point, as well as adding an index for the blog. I am also toying with the idea of implementing an auto update for the blog page when you scroll to the bottom (much like the facebook or reddit newsfeed), among other things. Suggestions are welcome!
