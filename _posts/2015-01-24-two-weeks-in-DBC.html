          <p>Full disclosure: I am writing this post right after successfully (and without too much trouble) finishing the Bistro weekend assessment challenge. Not going to lie, I'm on cloud nine right now. There's no feeling like successfully kicking butt at writing code that I would not have known how to write a mere 5 days ago. It. Feels. Amazing. I say this so you, dear reader, are completely aware that I have my rose-colored glasses on as I type this.</p>

          <p>Truthfully, it's been a roller coaster ride. I may feel like I'm on top of the world right now, but if you could've seen me on Wednesday night, you would've had to struggle through understanding what I was saying through heavy tear-induced hiccuping. Dev Bootcamp may be a lot of things, but--HOLY COW--it certainly not a joke. I have never been so proud of myself, and so disappointed at myself in a two-week period.</p>

          <p>If there is any consolation in times when I felt truly down, it is that my cohort, the Squirrels, are amazing. I love every single one of them. It is such a blessing to be amidst such amazing, driven, positive people. There may have been times where I put myself down out of sheer frustration, but every single time the people in my cohort have helped to build me back up. (If any of the Squirrels read this, know that I feel so blessed to know you, and I would plz like you to stay forever in San Francisco so we can hang out alls the time, kthx.<3 )</p>

          <p>The resources that are available to us are equally fantastic. There has been such an emphasis on taking care of oneself despite all the things we are learning--yoga, counseling, check-in, coaches, teachers, a designated mentor, fellow students...they're all there to help you out. There has been no time where I have felt helpless and alone because there have just been so many helpful people, both in my phase and in other phases. There are students that literally walk around, asking if anyone could use their assistance. There are coaches that will help you out, teachers that will take time out of the day to do booster sessions--literally everyone is helpful. There has never been any other time or place in my life where I've been privileged enough to walk in to a place with a hundred people, all of whom are willing to help.</p>

          <p>Which is why I say this: while the curriculum is extremely rigorous, what really makes DBC stand out--and the reason I've been truly loving every second of my experience--is the culture. It's a culture of giving, acceptance and understanding, where you just receive so many good things from people that you feel compelled to give so many good things to other people in turn. It's a cycle of kindness that has invigorated me to come in bright and early, excited to see the same faces I spent 12 hours with the previous day, and the day before that, and the day before that. Now, when I wake up in the morning, I feel eager to see my peers, eager to face the challenges of the day with them, eager for us to get closer to our collective goals together.</p>

          <p>In closing (mostly because it is now 12:20am and I still have a full day of coding tomorrow), things have been great. Attending DBC is easily the best decision I've made since 2007 when I decided to go to Berkeley. Feeling very content about where I am in my life at this moment.</p>
