          <p>For this week's blog post, I thought I would write about an enumerable that I've never used before, but was interested to learn about--cycle!</p>

          <p>But first, what is an enumerable? Well, enumerables provide collections classes such as arrays and hashes with the ability to be search through, manipulate, and sort. In particular, the <code>cycle</code> method allows you to cycle through each element in a collection repeatedly and in order for <i>n</i> times or forever if no limit is indicated. Another way to explain it is to say that <code>cycle</code> passes each element in your array into the code block. <code>cycle</code> starts over again at the beginning of the array once the last item has been passed to the block. To better visualize this, the syntax for <code>cycle</code> is as follows:</p>

          <pre><code>
cycle(n=nil) { |obj| block }
  # returns nil if the loop finishes without interruptions

# Note, a different (slightly longer) way to write the code above
# Replace the {} with the words 'do' and 'end'
cycle(n) do |obj|
  block
end

cycle(n=nil)
  # returns an enumerator if no block is given
          </code></pre>

          <p>In the above code, <i>n</i> indicates the number of cycles, <i>obj</i> is each element or key/value combo in your array or hash, and <i>block</i> is the code block where you tell the program what to do. You can see how this works below:</p>

          <pre><code>
# The array named 'months' contains the first 6 months of the year
months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June"]

months.cycle { |m| puts m }
  => January
     February
     March
     April
     May
     June
# ...this goes on forever, since I didn't indicate a limit
# You may want to Ctrl+C out of command line to stop it

# For a cycle with an end, see below:
months.cycle(2) { |m| puts m }
  => January
     February
     March
     April
     May
     June
     January
     February
     March
     April
     May
     June
          </code></pre>

          <p>There are other ways to put an end to the cycle method without indicating a parameter <code>n</code>, and one of them is to use <code>break</code>, like so:</p>

          <pre><code>
months.cycle do |m|
  puts m
  break if m == "March"
end
=> January
   February
   March
          </code></pre>

          <p>As you may have read above, if you don't include a code block when using the cycle method, you will return an enumerator. This is helpful for situation for when you'd like the objects of your array in a repeating, ordered sequence.</p>

          <pre><code>
half_a_year = months.cycle
=> returns an enumerator

# Now I am going to use the method 'next' to give us the following month
# This is useful just to see why you'd like to return an enumerator
puts half_a_year.next
=> January
puts half_a_year.next
=> February
puts half_a_year.next
=> March
puts half_a_year.next
=> April
puts half_a_year.next
=> May
puts half_a_year.next
=> June
puts half_a_year.next
=> January
          </code></pre>

          <p>Pretty easy, right? If anything wasn't clear, the best resource I had to figure this stuff out was <a href="http://www.globalnerdy.com/2008/07/06/enumerating-enumerable-enumerablecycle/">this site</a>. The author wrote quite a bit more about it than I did (and is probably less of a n00b than myself!). Go read on it a little, and then try it out for yourself!</p>
