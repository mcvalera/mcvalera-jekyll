          <p>I grew up in Manila, Philippines. My family and I moved to the US when I was 17, and since then it's been a curious experience of navigating race and culture, and figuring out how I fit into all of it.</p>

          <p>Truth be told, we had our own stereotypes when I was growing up, not so much in relation to my peers but in relation to people that were truly 'others'--people that we weren't really exposed to or understood (i.e. tribe folk and the like). I mention this to bring home the point that racial stereotypes aren't something I ever really thought about seriously before living here.</p>

          <p>Fast-forward to my experience in a junior college in the <i>very</i> small town of Sonora, CA, where all of a sudden I was perceived as a high-achieving asian who was thought to have previously lived in a hut on a farm...wait. <strong>WHAT?</strong></p>

          <p>I mean, I've always been a bit above average in school, but certainly would never have described myself as 'high-achieving,' and as for the hut on the farm... I mean. I still don't know how I feel about that to this day. Part baffled amusement, part incredulity, perhaps (I grew up in a city 1000x larger than that small town! With proper buildings! o.O ). I guess it's just that I had never thought that I was any kind of a stereotype until that time, and it was just SO WEIRD.</p>

          <p>Stereotype threat is defined as 'the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype.' Reading a few articles on it has encouraged me to think of stereotypes in general from a new perspective.</p>

          <p>Thankfully, the stereotypes that I got weren't all that harmful to me. I didn't really let it affect me in the sense that I kind of just went about my day, and kept doing well in school. As for the hut in the farm, I think most people figured out within the first couple of times they spoke to me that I've always been a city girl. Note that the stereotypes I've been given aren't really all that harmful or negative in the larger scale of things, unlike the experience of a lot of other people. In that sense, my experience is certainly not standard.</p>

          <p>It's harder to ignore the stereotypes when they're more malicious, when they take a stab at a person's supposed lack of intelligence or morality. I truly can't imagine how horrible and frustrating that might be. But the least I can do is try to be conscious of my approach to other people, and be mindful of my thoughts and expectations of them. I also think it's helpful to remind people of the fallacy of stereotypes when they unthinkingly assign them to other people, or when they think they themselves are falling into one.</p>
